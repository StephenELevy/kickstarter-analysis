# Module 1 Challenge

## Deliverable 1 is Pivot Table and Line Chart showing Theater Outcomes based Launch Date (months) Instructions

* The Theatre parent category pivot table shows 839 successful launches, 493 failed launches, and 37 canceled launches from 
January through December (years 2009-2017).

* The line chart shows the highest number of successful launches in May and tapering down toward the end of the year. The fewest successful outcomes occur at the end of the year within the holiday season.

* The line chart shows the failed launches to be pretty concistent throughout the year.

* The line chart shows that canceled launches make up the smallest number of outcomes and are consistent throughout the year.

**The summer months are the best time to launch theater campaigns and the end of the year is the worst time to launch theater campaigns"**

## Deliverable 2 is Outcomes vs monetary goals of successful, failed, and canceled outcomes for Plays.

* The highest percentage of successful outcomes occure for plays that cost $5000 or less and for plays that cost $35000-$45000.

* The highest percentage of failed outcomes occurs for plays that cost $25000-$35000 and for plays that cost $45000-$50000.

* The sort order of my subcategory column became corrupted and yielded wrong values for successful, failed, and canceled outcomes. I had to go back to the orignal kickstarter data and reproduce the subcategory column in order to produce correct numbers for successful, failed, and canceled outcomes.

**The sheets containing Deliverables 1 & 2 are called "Theatre Outcomes vs Launch" and "Play Outcomes Based on Goals."**

**The .PNG files showing "Theatre Outcomes Based on Launch Date" and "Play Outcomes Based on Goals" are contained in the Resource Folder.**
